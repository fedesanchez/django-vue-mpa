# Django + Vue Multi Page Application (MPA)

> A common myth is that an SPA is necessary to use a front-end framework like Vue or React.

When developers talk about using Vue with Django, they often talk about building a Vue SPA and a Django API, hosted on separate servers. This is also known as decoupled front and back ends.

Inspired by this article [
You don't have to build a separate app to use Vue with Django](https://ctrlzblog.com/add-vue-to-your-django-templates-with-vite/) i decided to test if you can get the full benefits of a JavaScript development environment without creating a separate codebase for your frontend.

## Things to try

-   Can you import vue components in django templates?
-   Can you add a third party js vue dependency like vue-charts?
-   Can you use Class Based Views ?
-   Deploy a production version
